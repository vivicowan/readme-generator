## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a gigantic, well-organized, user-friendly library of documentation.  I built this project to create a more managable way to find the documentation I may need for a certain method that I may be curious about.  This project solves to problem of information overload. I know that when I was a beginner at coding, I had hundreds of tabs open relating to different kinds of documentation, this was a bit overwhelming.  I learned that this can be useful way for beginner coders to get there information.
